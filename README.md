The nice and friendly bot, which integrates Taiga into your telegram-team-chat (https://telegram.org/), so you can perfectly use telegram in your workflow.

Taiga (https://taiga.io) is a very strong agile project management tool, totally free - just try!

## how to use
Add me to your team-group-chat like one of your collegues and I'll explain you all further steps - okay, there's just one further step. :D But after that, we won't just be collegues, we will be friends, never missing anything what's happening in your taiga project - promised!

## support

It's open source, so make your changes and push them again!

## how to reuse
Feel free to fork the project and create your own bot with the telegram bot api (https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). 
I'd recommend to derive from TelegramBotv2.php, which is already implementing necessary methods for communicating. In your derived class,
implement all your specific bot methods. As an example, just have a look at TaigagramBot.php

I'd be glad if you'd leave a short notice about me!
